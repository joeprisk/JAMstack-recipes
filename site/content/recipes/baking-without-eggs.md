  So many times have I have said to my daughter lets do some baking only to
  discover I only have half of the ingredients which means I have to get
  creative and substitute ingredients finding healthy and delicious
  replacements. I love a challenge, I find it makes cooking a lot more fun. Some
  of my favourite happy accidents and most successful recipes have been
  discovered this way! So next time you find a recipe you want to try and want
  to replace eggs due to allergy, dietary needs or like me realise you don't
  have any give these a try they make a good replacement. Most people wouldn't
  even notice any difference in flavor. 


  I will also be adding more healthy dairy free substitutions for milk, butter
  and natural sugar replacements. So watch this space!

1. **Applesauce:** Use 60ml of unsweetened applesauce per egg required. Also I add a about 1/2 tsp extra baking powder. I find this adds natural sweetness to your recipe too so I usually half the amount of sugar you need. This is my favorite sub as it is a healthier option. 
2. **Banana:** Use 60ml Of mashed banana in place of one egg. There will be a mild banana flavor so if you aren't a fan I would try one of the other options. I also find banana adds sweetness so you may want to reduce the amount of sugar.
3. **Flaxseeds: **Use 1 tbsp of ground flaxseeds and 3 level tbsps of water until fully absorbed In place of one egg. You can buy pre ground or grind your own in a coffee or spice grinder. 
4. **Oil:** Use 60ml of mild flavored oil, Most Vegetable based oils work well but, Canola oil, Corn oil, Mild olive oil, Coconut are my favorite. If the recipe requires more than one egg I recommend using one of the other options as well because the oil can make your food a little too greasy. 
5. **Aquafaber: **The liquid that beans such as chickpeas come in. Use 3 tbsp per replaced egg. This is best used in place for recipes that require egg whites like meringue and mousse but can be used in other baking too but will make a much moister texture than eggs do.
