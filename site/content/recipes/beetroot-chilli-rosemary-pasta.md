1. Put a large pan of water on to boil.
2. In a separate pan heat the oil then add chopped onion & rosemary and fry for 10 minutes on a low heat. Stir occasionally. If it looks like it is drying out too much add a splash of water or I like to use the liquid from the beetroot pack.
3. Once the onion is cooked add the Garlic, Chilli (Or red pepper if you don't want it spicy) and beetroot and cook for a further 5 minutes adding a few tablespoons of water to loosen the beetroot and help it cook. 
4. This step is optional... I take about half the beet mix and whizz it up in a blender to add more depth of flavor and get better sauce coverage. Pour it back in to the Pan. 
5. Add pasta to the beetroot Mix add the Parmesan cheese and toss together and season to taste.
