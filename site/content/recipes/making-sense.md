description: >-
  I love to experiment with dairy alternatives and these are by far the best
  scones I have ever tasted quick, easy and delicious! The coconut flavor is
  very subtle. I love these served with my homemade Berry Chia seed jam - a
  match made in heaven! You could also take it to the next level and serve with
  some coconut cream.

1. Preheat oven to 220C (200C Fan)/390F/Gas 6 and line baking tray with baking parchment.
2. Rub coconut oil into the flour until a fine breadcrumb consistency
3. Add baking powder, Sugar, Salt and combine.
4. Make a well in the center and pour in Coconut milk and mix until a soft dough forms.
5. lightly dust work surface, layout dough and at flatten to about a 1 1/2 inch thickness and cut cut your desired shape. I usually get about 10 scones. 
6.  Place on to the lined baking tray and put in the middle shelf in the oven and cook for 12 - 15 minutes. they should be a lovely golden colour and they should sound hollow when you tap the bottom.
7. Once cooked allow to cool on a wire rack.

These are delicious smothered with a generous dollop of Berry Chia Jam!
