  Delicious beetroot and onion chutney packed with a sweet and spicy chilli
  kick. This flavoursome chutney is great paired with cheese and biscuits, in
  sandwiches or quiches, on a pizza. Also makes a perfect gift.

1. Heat olive oil in a large sauce pan
2. Finely slice onions and fry for 10 minutes until soft 
3. Cook for a further 20 minutes on a low heat stirring frequently until onions have caramelised
4. Add the rest of the ingredients keep on a low heat until all of the sugar has dissolved then increase the temperature and simmer for 30 minutes. 
5. Spoon mixture into hot sterile jars, I usually get 3 out of this recipe. Store in a cool dark place. Once opened store in the fridge.
