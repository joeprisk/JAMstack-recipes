1. Preheat oven to 180C (350F/Gas 4).
2. With a 12cm cutter cut circles from wrap (you should get 3 circles per wrap).
3. Line 6 muffin tin holes with the tortilla circles. 
4. Add a sprinkle of cheese and 1/2 a cherry tomato in each and a little black pepper (Optional).
5. Beat eggs and pour evenly between the tortilla cases.
6. Bake for 15 minutes until the egg is set. 

Serving suggestion: serve with vegetable sticks and hummus. Great as part of a main meal or on their own as a quick snack. Also good to chuck in lunchboxes too.
