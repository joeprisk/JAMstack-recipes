1. Preheat oven 180c/350f/Gas 4
2. Add all ingredients to a large mixing bowl and knead until it forms a ball of dough
3. Lightly flour the surface and roll out the dough and cut out desired shapes (we use a skewer to draw the faces etc before baking)
4. Place the gingerbread biscuits on a lined baking tray
5. Bake for about 15 minutes until they start to brown
6. Cool and decorate if you desire! 

Enjoy!
