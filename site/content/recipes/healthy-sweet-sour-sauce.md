  A perfect blend of sweet, Sour and fruity! This recipe is incredibly versatile
  delicious as a sauce served with stir fried veg and brown rice or noodles.
  Yummy used a dipping sauce too. This tangy sauce is great for a speedy healthy
  mid week dinner. You will never want to eat takeaway sweet and sour sauce
  again after trying this recipe.
