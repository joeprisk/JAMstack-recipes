  Healthy and deliciously decadent. Adding beetroot to your muffins is a really
  great way sneak vegetables into your diet and you wouldn't even know they are
  in these yummy muffins. The beetroot brings out the lovely rich chocolatey
  flavour and creates a moist texture also a subtle earthy flavor. A winner all
  round in my house and fun for the kids to help making these too.
