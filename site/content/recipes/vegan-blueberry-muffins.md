1. Preheat oven to 200C (400F, Gas 6) line muffin tray, I got 8 muffins out of this recipe.
2. Mix flour, Sugar, Baking powder and Salt in a large mixing bowl until combined.
3. In another bowl add the measured out Applesauce, Coconut oil, Vanilla and Milk.
4. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients mix until they form a thick batter, it should be scoopable not runny. Be sure not to over mix.
5. Add the Blueberries and stir them evenly through. 
6. Spoon into muffin cases. 
7. Put in the oven on the middle shelf for 15-20 minutes. Until golden brown.
