  A yummy sugar free snack or a healthy way to start the day. Perfect for
  children and babies. These muffins are a great way to sneak extra veggies into
  their diet. A deliciously moist cross between banana bread and carrot cake
  what more could you want. I had lots of fun making these with my daughter too.

1. Preheat oven to 180C (350F/Gas 4) and Line a 12 hole muffin tray.
2. In a large mixing bowl add flour, baking powder and cinnamon.
3. In a separate bowl mash the bananas. 
4. Add the melted butter, vanilla and beaten eggs to the mashed banana. 
5. Pour the dry ingredients into the Banana mixture.
6. Then add the grated carrot and raisins. 
7. Spoon into the muffin cases about 2 tablespoons per case. 
8. Place in the oven for about 15-20 minutes until golden brown on top. 
9. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes or until completely cooled and enjoy! 

These can easily be made vegan too by using coconut oil in place of butter and applesauce instead of eggs (60ml applesauce per egg).
