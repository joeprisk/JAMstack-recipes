  This fruity recipe is very versatile and works really well with most fresh or
  frozen fruit (Frozen summer fruits works really well) and is a quick healthy
  sugar free alternative. It lasts a week in the fridge... if you have any left
  it is very moreish! It is yummy on its own, but I love this on Vegan Scones
  (https://www.sugar-and-spice.uk/recipes/vegan-scones/) my daughter really
  loves it spread on Banana pancakes!

1. Add fruit and honey to saucepan, Simmer for 10 minutes.
2. Mash until a smooth(ish) consistency.
3. Add chia seeds, stir them in then lower the heat and simmer for a further 20 minutes.
4. Once cooked leave to cool then pour into jars. (I usually get 2 jars out of this recipe).
5. Enjoy!
